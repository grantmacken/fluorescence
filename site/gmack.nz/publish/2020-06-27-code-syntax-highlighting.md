There are a few 
[HTML code block syntax highlighting](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/140/top-5-best-code-syntax-highlighter-javascript-plugins) scripts you can use.

I took a look at [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) because it seemed to be
the most widely used. I had some trouble setting it up so I moved onto 
['prism.js'](https://prismjs.com), which I am quite happy with.

The hardest part is remembering what languages you can highlight.

 - bash
 - clike
 - css
 - docker
 - elixir
 - erlang
 - git
 - javascript
 - lua
 - makefile
 - markdown
 - markup 
 - nginx
 - vim
 - xquery
 - yaml
