This blog is a rework of a previous project, where I initially started to
explore using xqerl for web development projects. Like every other blog I'll
write and about the stuff I am interested in, which will most likely centre
around 'declarative markup' tech. Initially I am going to write about, how I am
putting this site together.

Eventually this page will generate itself, in the meantime
a list of recent articles are in the aside.
