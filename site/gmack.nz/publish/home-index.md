This domain is a rework of a previous project, where I initially started to
explore using [xqerl](https://github.com/zadean/xqerl) for web development
projects. Like every other blog I'll write and about the stuff I am interested
in, which will most likely centre around 'declarative markup' tech. Initially I
am going to write about, how I am putting this site together.
